    <p>Today, the naginata is most often seen in the form of competitive sport called "new Naginata" (新しいなぎなた, atarashii naginata), or simply "Naginata", which focuses on sparring with protective equipment and bamboo and wooden weapons.</p>

    <p>Historically this sport was predominantly taught as physical education at girls schools in Japan, and the practice of naginata in Japan retains that gender imbalance. Outside of Japan, the gender split of practitioners is approximately 50:50.</p>
